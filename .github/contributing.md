- Please try to [combine multiple commits before pushing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6934752/combining-multiple-commits-before-pushing-in-git)

- Please use `TDD` when fixing bugs. This means that you should write a unit test that fails because it reproduces the issue, then fix the issue finally run the test to ensure that the issue has been resolved. This helps us to prevent fixed bugs from happening again in the future.

- Please keep the test coverage at 100%. Write additional unit test if necessary
